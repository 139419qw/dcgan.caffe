# dcgan.caffe: A pure caffe-python implementation of [DC-GAN](https://github.com/soumith/dcgan.torch)
======================================================================================

As far as I know, there is no light-weight implementation of DCGAN based on caffe.

Inspired by [DeePSiM](http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/binaries/arxiv2016_alexnet_inversion_with_gans/release_deepsim_v0.5.zip) implementation, a few lines of python code can train the dcgan model quickly without any hack in caffe core lib ([Dosovitskiy](https://github.com/dosovits/caffe-fr-chairs/tree/deepsim) has already done this. However, I think the code could be merged back to master branch).

The training and generating code will be released in days.
